time code:

	LARGE_INTEGER  t1, t2;           // ticks
	double elapsedTime;

	QueryPerformanceFrequency(&frequency);
	QueryPerformanceCounter(&t1);

	QueryPerformanceCounter(&t2);

	elapsedTime = (t2.QuadPart - t1.QuadPart) * 1000.0 / frequency.QuadPart;
	cout << "That iteration took " << elapsedTime << "ms" << endl;

	elapsedTime = elapsedTime / 1000.0;
	cout << "That iteration took " << elapsedTime << "s" << endl;
